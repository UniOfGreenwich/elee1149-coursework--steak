# Sprint 1 Review: January 15, 2025 - January 22, 2025

**Sprint Goal:** Prepare documentation outlines, design a high-level system architecture, list requirements, and compile basic feature flowcharts.

## Sprint Accomplishments

1. **Documentation Outline:**
   - **Completed By:** Harrison & Gareth
   - **Outcome:** Successfully prepared outlines for project documentation, including templates for the project charter, user stories, sprint planning, technical documentation, and quality assurance.

2. **High-Level System Design:**
   - **Completed By:** Gareth & Lewis
   - **Outcome:** Designed a high-level system architecture using Figma, creating a visual representation of the system's architecture, including major components and interactions.

3. **Requirements Listing:**
   - **Completed By:** Gareth, Lewis, Harrison & Jack
   - **Outcome:** Gathered and documented all functional and non-functional requirements to define the project scope and functionalities.

## Outstanding Tasks

- **Readme Template:**
  - **Pending By:** Gareth
  - **Description:** Creation of a README template is still needed to provide project overview and setup instructions.

## Team Reflections

- **Progress Summary:** The team successfully completed the primary objectives set for Sprint 1, including documentation outlines, system architecture design, requirements listing, feature flowcharts, and database design and implementation.
- **Challenges:** The main challenge faced was ambiguity in requirements gathering, which was mitigated by scheduling a requirements clarification meeting.
- **Tools Utilized:** The team utilized Markdown via a Git repository for documentation, Figma for design, and Miro for flowcharts.

Overall, Sprint 1 was productive, with all major tasks completed as planned, setting a strong foundation for the upcoming sprints. The team will focus on completing the remaining readme template task and preparing for the next sprint.
