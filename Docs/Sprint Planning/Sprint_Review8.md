## Team Reflections

- **Progress Summary:** Despite half of the team being unavailable during this sprint, significant progress was made in finalizing the Budgeting frontend and enhancing visualizations. However, the Dashboard styling and comprehensive QA testing needed to be deferred to the next sprint.
- **Challenges:** Limited team availability impacted the completion of some tasks, highlighting the need for better resource management and planning for upcoming sprints.
- **Tools Utilized:** Utilized React, CSS, JavaScript, Python for development; Pytest for testing; and Git for version control.

Overall, Sprint 8 was productive with key achievements, but some tasks had to be carried over to Sprint 9. The team is prepared to address these in the upcoming two-week sprint.
