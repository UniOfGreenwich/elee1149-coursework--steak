### Discussion Points

#### [Initial Thoughts]

- **Participants:** [Lewis & Gareth]
- **Key Points:**
  - [Discussed the design of the login and sign-up screens.]
  - [Lewis raised concerns about the space constraints for text fields, including name, username, date of birth, email, password, and security questions. Gareth suggested making the screen scrollable in Figma to accommodate all fields.]
  - [Gareth proposed having separate screens for login and sign-up, while Lewis considered combining them. They discussed the feasibility of each approach and the potential impact on user experience.]

#### [Require Inpute From Other Team Members]

- **Participants:** [Lewis & Gareth]
- **Key Points:**
  - [Need for Input: Lewis mentioned that he was stuck on certain questions and needed input from other team members to proceed with the design. He emphasized the importance of collaboration to address these issues.]
  - [Basic Fields: They agreed to proceed with the basic username and password fields for now, postponing more complex features like "forgot password" to a later stage due to their technical complexity.

#### [Design Preferences]

- **Participants:** [Lewis & Gareth]
- **Key Points:**
  - [Gareth and Lewis discussed their design preferences, with Gareth favoring a minimalist approach. They agreed to incorporate ideas from both of their styles to create a balanced design.]

#### [Practicality of Design]

- **Participants:** [Lewis & Gareth]
- **Key Points:**
-  - [Implementation Challenges: They discussed the difficulty of creating a design that the development team can practically implement. Lewis highlighted the need to ensure the initial design is robust to avoid significant changes later.]
   -  - [Initial Blueprint: Gareth mentioned the importance of having a solid blueprint for the design to ensure everything works smoothly. They agreed that a well-thought-out initial design is crucial for the project's success.]

### Decisions Made

- **Simplicity is key:** [Reduce overcrowding of text, images, effects etc. too much of these things takes away from a sleek modern look.]
- **Keep it user friendly:** [With the log in and sign up screens we again do not want too much over crowding, keep the information the users are presented with to just what is necessary.]

## Follow-up Tasks
1. **Sign Up Form:**
   - Create a basic sign-up form with username and password fields first, then expand it with additional fields.  *(Lewis)*

2. **Experiment:**
   - Construct some simple design ideas to inspire eachothers full designs. *(Lewis & Gareth)*

3. **Prototyping:**
   - Provide mobile and desktop frames for design templates. *(Gareth)*

4. **UI Research:**
   - Visit inspiration websites, Plum, Robinhood, Freetrade, Revolut, etc. and understand log in/sign up processes. *(Gareth)*

5. **Design Construct:**
    - Create some designs with varying styles and colour themes to share with the developers in order to present them with options. *(Lewis & Gareth)*

6. **Present Ideas:**
    - Set up a meeting with development team to discuss the practicality of the designs and gain feedback to produce a finalised design. *(Lewis)*
