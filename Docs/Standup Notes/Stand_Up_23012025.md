### Discussion Points

#### UI Progress Review & Demo

- **Participants:** Jack, Lewis, Gareth
- **Key Points:**
  - Jack presented UI updates including new stock images (Figma), button color changes, and a (currently non-functional) login page. Harrison's input is required for backend functionality.
  - The sign-up page, also presented, includes encrypted data; backend implementation is Harrison's responsibility. Logo and font size changes are needed on this page.
  - Jack demonstrated a "forgot password" page, highlighting the need for design discussion with Harrison, including the addition of security questions.
  - A responsive mobile view of the login page was shown. Further adjustments to element sizes may improve user experience.
  - Gareth suggested adding outlines around carousel images (Jack agreed to implement).
  - Gareth requested thicker button outlines (3px thickness was agreed upon).

#### Mobile Responsiveness & Navigation Design

- **Participants:** Lewis, Gareth, Jack
- **Key Points:**
  - Mobile view design includes a vertical layout and adjustments to element sizes for better usability.
  - Navigation options were discussed: a permanent navigation bar for desktop, and a slide-out component (overlay or push) for mobile. Moving the navigation bar to the top for mobile was also considered, along with button pills.

#### Backend Integration & Security Consideration

- **Participants:** Jack, Gareth & Lewis
- **Key Points:**
  - Harrison is needed to complete the login page functionality and handle backend aspects of the sign-up page (data encryption).
  - Password requirements (capital letters, numbers) need to be defined and implemented.
  - The design of the "forgot password" page needs to be finalized with Harrison, including the potential for username confirmation and security questions.
 
#### Next Steps & Feature Prioritisation

- **Participants:** Jack, Gareth & Lewis
- **Key Points:**
  - High priority: Creating the "first-time bank account" form (following the sign-up page).
  - Next: Designing the homepage (basics and fundamentals).
  - Exploration of a slide-out navigation component (similar to GitHub).
  - Lewis will research a financial news API for integration.
  - A daily catch-up meeting was scheduled for the following day.
