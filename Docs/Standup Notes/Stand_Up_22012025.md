### Discussion Points

#### Sign-up Form Refinement

- **Participants:** Jack
- **Key Points:**
  - Jack needs to discuss the password and confirm password fields with Harrison to ensure proper setup within the sign-up form.

#### Design Revamp & Consistency

- **Participants:** Lewis, Gareth, Jack
- **Key Points:**
  - Dark Theme & Minimalism: The team adopted a dark theme with a minimalist design. A consistent look across the application is a priority.
  - Team Name Change: The team officially changed its name from "High Stakes" to "Stake". Lewis highlighted the increased flexibility this provides for website purpose and design.
  - Color Scheme: Bright colors will be used for actions (withdrawals, deposits) against the dark theme for better visual appeal and navigation.
  - Logo Change: A potential logo change was discussed. The current logo's color can be easily adjusted if a new logo is adopted.
  - Design Consistency: Curved edges and color-coded separation of login/back buttons are crucial for consistency. Gareth and Lewis will be in charge of maintaining this.
  - Icon Size & "Pockets" Concept: Icon sizes were adjusted to address previous "clunkiness." Gareth introduced the "pockets" concept for budgeting and money jars, to be displayed on the homepage and linked to detailed sections via the sidebar.

#### Home Page Layout & Feature Implementation

- **Participants:** Jack, Gareth & Lewis
- **Key Points:**
  - Home Page Layout: Initial focus will be on the left-hand side menu, leaving the homepage relatively blank initially. An iterative approach will be used, building features individually before finalizing the homepage layout.
  - New Transaction Button: A new transaction button will be added, with placement to be determined (top or below recent transactions).
  - Recent Transactions: Placement will be adjusted to accommodate the new transaction button.
Search Bar Removal: The search bar will be removed as it's deemed unnecessary for the current design.
  - Transaction History: Incoming and outgoing transaction history will be displayed, with a "plus" button for new transactions.
  - Mobile View: A mobile view is essential. A burger menu for the sidebar and a vertical layout for the homepage are proposed.
 
#### Data Export Functionality

- **Participants:** Jack, Gareth & Lewis
- **Key Points:**
  - The team discussed adding a data export function. Jack suggested Harrison could create the function to retrieve data from the database.
